# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

**Codeblocks in markdown make it very easy for tech folks to copy, paste, share code.**
_A good cloud engineer uses Codeblocks whenever possible._
~~This line was a total mistake~~

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate and research issues.

**Codeblocks**

- A sample code block is added below:
- Codeblocks are very useful to highlight codes in a block

```
void main ()
a=10
b=20
code = a+b
print code

```

- When you can, you should attempt to apply syntax highlighting.
- Shown below

```ruby

void main ()
a=10
b=20
code = a+b
print code

```

- I can add sample images to this place
- Shown below

- I can add a smaller image if I want to.
- See below

- I can do the same in below format when I drop the image in a folder within the repo.
- See below.

- Good Cloud Engineers use clodeblocks to show errors that appear in the console.
- Here is a sample of using a codeblock for an error that appears in bash

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
        2: from /usr/bin/irb:23:in '<main>'
        1: from (irb):1
RuntimeError: This is a custom error message
```
> Here is an example of code error in bash

##Hell, I can use tables too.

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |

- I made a cheat sheet using this link. Check [^4] for the same.  :smile:

| S.No 	| Name  	| City      	| State 	| Country 	|
|------	|-------	|-----------	|-------	|---------	|

| 2    	| Asha  	| Toronto   	| ON    	| Canada  	|
| 3    	| Ghost 	| NorthYork 	| ON    	| Canada  	|

## Finally, I am making footnotes

- Here is a cheatsheet to Emojis - [Github emoji cheat sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md#smileys--emotion)
- Here is a simple footnote[^1].
- A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
  This is a second line.
